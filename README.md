# Course-3-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
Coursera R Specialization Course 3 final project
Class Project for "Getting and Cleaning Data"
The final project for Getting and Cleaning Data was to utilize the ["Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones"](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) data set, tidy and analyze that data set, then return a tidy data set.

Follow these steps before running this script:

* Navigate to the directory where you wish to download all applicable data and the script
* Download the following R packages:
  dplyr
  data.table
  tidyr

The output of the R script is a tidy, grouped data set called grouped_dataset_run_analysis.txt.

You can read more about the data and the analysis in the code book.
